# Questions for public interviews

* The following are a series of questions that worked really well for the Women in the Wikimedia movement conversation series. These questions have a double goal: 
* 1. To help participants reflect on the issues of gender and participation in the open web. *
* 2. To portray women's work in a way that honours their dedication, and helps them to connect to other women working in the open web.*

In your personal journey as a woman in open web, have you ever encountered any boundaries?

Thinking about the project you led, what made you feel empowered to do it? 

How does the cultural context influence gender equality in Wikimedia programs? 

Have you observed a majority of men, women or gender non-conforming people participating in your project? Could you speak some to what motivates women and gender non-conforming people to contribute?

Do you address the gender gap when working on your project? Do you work from a gender perspective?

As a woman contributing to this open project, is there anything in this context that makes you feel empowered to act, that you donâ€™t find in other contexts where you live?

Did you or do you have a mentor? Is there someone that you feel like you have learned a lot from? Is there anyone that made you feel empowered to step into this organizing role? 

Do you feel like open web culture describe the way you work with others on everyday life? 

Do you remember a time when you were inspired by others? What steps did you take to affect change?

What traits would you like to see more of among leaders and organizers in this movement?
