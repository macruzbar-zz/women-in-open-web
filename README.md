# Women in open web
A space for conversation that focuses only on women working in open culture. 

**Thank you for being here!** :tada:

The gender gap is a divide that characterizes multiple spheres in every person's life. Where are women thriving? What are the challenges they face working in open culture? How can we best support women leaders? The conversation series *Women in Open Web* focuses on women leaders who are working to make the web a more diverse and inclusive environment for everyone. It's a series of public events - virtual or in-person - where a facilitator brings together 2 or 3 women to talk about their work, their challenges, and what they need to succeed. 

Why is it important to support women leaders?
For every woman that feels empowered to contribute to an open project, there are probably a dozen others from under-represented groups that don’t feel like they can participate. 

Women’s contributions in the open web often focus on underrepresented themes, emphasizing human-to-human connections, and empowering contributors to be autonomous.  


These elements are key to creating a safe environment for newcomers to feel empowered to participate in the open web.
